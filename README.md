# 1. Danny's Diner

## ⭕ Problem Statement 
Danny is growing a Japanese restaurant, but he's missing the insights he needs to truly understand his customers. He doesn’t have a clear view of how often his customers visit, how much they spend, or which menu items they love the most. Without this information, it’s difficult for him to build deeper relationships with his loyal customers or make confident decisions about expanding his loyalty program. Additionally, his team doesn’t have the technical skills to dig into the raw data, which means they can’t quickly answer important questions or make data-driven decisions.

## Danny needs answers to the following questions 
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
